//Assignment-2 Q-1
/*Implement a class Account. An account has
        •	a balance
        •	functions to add
        •	and withdraw money,
        •	and a function to inquire about the current balance.
Condition:
       1.	Pass a value into a constructor to set an initial balance.
       2.	If no value is passed the initial balance should be set to $0.
       3.	Charge a $5 penalty if an attempt is made to withdraw more money than is available in the account.
       4.	Enhance the Account class to compute interest on the current balance.*/
